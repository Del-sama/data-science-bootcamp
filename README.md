# Fundamentals
## 1_Linear Algebra and Matrices
#### Linear Algebra
* Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces. It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra)
#### Matrices
* Two-dimensional array of numbers.
* Can be represented as a list of lists
#### Basic Operatons
* [Addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_addition)
* [Scalar multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_multiplication)
* [Transpose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose)

## 2_Hash functions, Binary tree, O(n)
#### Hash Functions
* A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed size. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function)
* Hash functions has a list of functions which include - comparing large amounts of data, Indexing data, generating random strings - [Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/506029/whats-the-purpose-in-hashing-information).
#### Binary tree
* A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)

#### O(n)
* In computer science, big O notation is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation)
* Big O notation describes the efficiency of an algorithm.
* Algorithms are judged by either their space complexity (how much working storage an algorithm needs) or time complexity (how much time it takes an algorithm to run).
